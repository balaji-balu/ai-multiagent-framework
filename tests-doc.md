These test files comprehensively validate the AI multi-agent framework's functionality. Here's what I've included:

Unit Tests:

agent_test.cpp: Tests the base Agent class with a mock implementation
agent_factory_test.cpp: Verifies agent creation with different types and configurations
agent_manager_test.cpp: Tests agent lifecycle and message routing
framework_test.cpp: Verifies framework initialization, startup, and shutdown
learning_agent_test.cpp: Tests the learning agent implementation
rule_based_agent_test.cpp: Tests the rule-based agent implementation


Integration Test:

integration_test.cpp: End-to-end test using the REST API to create, communicate with, and destroy agents


Build System:

A CMake configuration with proper test discovery and linking against required libraries



The tests follow best practices:

Each test file focuses on a specific component
Tests are organized into sections for better readability
Appropriate fixtures and setup/teardown are used
Tests verify both positive and negative cases (error handling)
The integration test validates the full system functionality

The testing approach follows the Test-Driven Development methodology, with comprehensive test coverage across all components. The tests verify thread safety, proper error handling, and correct behavior in various scenarios.
